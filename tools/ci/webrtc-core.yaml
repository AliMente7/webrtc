# MixedReality-WebRTC build pipeline for CI
# Build the core WebRTC implementation and the UWP wrappers

# Disable branch and PR triggers, the core implementation only changes
# when upgrading to a more recent version from Google, which is quite
# infrequent. Also this pipeline is very long (several hours) so should
# be triggered manually only when needed.
